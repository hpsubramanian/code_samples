# Bioinformatics Coding Samples

This repository contains responses to three bioinformatics coding challenges. The samples are to show some of my coding ability.

## Time Constraints

Please note that the challenges were time-constrained and a number of improvements are possible. My goal was to deliver a minimum viable product. Possible improvements to the code are listed in the README of each challenge.

## Challenges

1. **Bioinformatic API Server** - involved developing a web service to handle genomic data.
2. **Design Engineer Coding Challenge v6** - involved generating options for knock-out BRCA1 in a human cell line.
3. **Genomics Coding Challenge** - involved processing a FASTQ file to identify UMI's and performing analysis on the UMI's.
